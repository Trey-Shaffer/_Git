This is an input/configuration file for script, FileDist.ps1.
All the values listed are optional in this file.
Leave all tags present, without content, if not used in this file.

FileVersion - The version/format of this file.

SourceComputer - The computer holding the source files for distribution.
SourceShare    - The share name used to access source files.
SourcePath     - The path, below the SourceShare, to the source files folder.
These three components are combined to form the source UNC path:
	\\<SourceComputer>\<SourceShare>\<SourcePath>

TargetShare - Share name expected on every computer in <ServerList>.
TargetPath  - The path, below the TargetShare, to the target folder.
These two components are combined with the computer names in the <ServerList>.

DeleteContent - The presence of any value acts as a switch.  This triggers
				  deletion of all files in the target folder prior to
				  copy of new files.

DeleteContentOnly - The presence of any value acts as a switch.  This triggers
					  deletion of all files in the target folder.  No files
					  are copied after the deletion.

		   of the target path/folder if it does not exist.  The target Share
		   must exist prior to running script.

			verbose mode output.
